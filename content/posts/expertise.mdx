## Meetings

I gathered multiple times with my company mentor and the project managers to give them my insight and advice regarding different projects, also playing a role as Web Accessibility expert.

## Web Accessibility within Bravoure Advice

After extensive research, I bundled all the knowledge attained and made it concise so the problems about accessibility in Bravoure’s websites were clear.

I also communicate the possible solutions available, which are:

*   Client Targeted Solution
*   VS Code Assistance
*   Other currently available tools

All of this can be found in the following document: [Web Accessibility For Bravoure](/images/1.4-Web-Accessibility-For-Bravoure.pdf).

The company’s CTO and my internship mentor were very glad to see all my progress.

Furthermore, the feedback that I received was that I could also bundle all of the solutions in one single place making it easy to reach. So instead of creating an extension that would only work on a certain text editor, I could make this tool available online so it wasn’t dependent on any text editor.

In addition, I bundled some other tools in the following document, showing which tools might be handy and which not: [VS Code Accessibility Extensions](/images/1.5-VS-Code-Accessibility-Extensions.pdf).

## Eye Museum Accessibility Advice

Eye Museum is a semi government instance, therefore it is required to fulfill a certain degree of the official WCAG accessibility guidelines. The project managers at Bravoure reached out to me in order to seek advice on whether or not this is currently possible. The Eye Museum website was built and crafted by Bravoure, but no accessibility concerns were targeted from the briefing, leaving this out of scope in the beginning.

We were given a list of accessibility issues and the project managers outlined the most important ones.

Given my role as accessibility expert inside the company, I proceeded to review each issue and list down the possible solutions, as well as building a proof of concept based on their current website menu.

You can download the accessibility issues together with my advice for each issue here: [Eye Museum Accessibility Problems](/images/Eye-Museum-Accessibility-Problems.pdf).

POC: [https://codesandbox.io/s/react-a11y-menu-rno4w](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-a11y-menu-rno4w)

The project managers were very pleased, and afterwards we also created a list with my solutions where a time span was attached for each task so they could create a future plan for implementation.

## Werken Bij Kindergarden Full Website

At the beginning of my internship I was given the task of rebuilding the whole website of Werken Bij Kindergarden.

This website was built with Wordpress as a CMS and was really outdated. The developers at the company had built their very own theme. The main challenge was getting acquainted with very old code practices, fixing these and not breaking anything. It was tedious work, but I managed to get through every new error and fulfil my task.

The company CTO and the project manager for this project were very happy and the project launched online. You can see it here: [https://werkenbijkindergarden.nl/](https://werkenbijkindergarden.nl/)

For this project we used the scrum board method for staying organized.

## Change Inc.

On the contrary of Werken Bij Kindergarden, Change Inc. is built with the latest technologies such Next.js and Craft CMS, as well as GraphQL. These were exactly the technologies that I wanted to work with and get to know. Luckily for me I was able to join the team and build new parts of the website, such as:

### Events Page Accordion

### Article Content

The components I built were added to the production line for later review.

## Final Conclusion

I effectively communicated with the stakeholders all my findings and defended the implementation of the available solutions. The hardest part was synthesising my findings since there was so much information. At the end I managed to do that by breaking down all the pieces into smaller chunks of information and creating a diagram, also with some examples.

Apart from running my main project within Bravoure, I showed the team that I am also of value for other projects that involve the inspection of a website’s accessibility, rebuilding an entire website which required me to quickly get acquainted with older practices and in general translating a design to code with accessibility in mind. This also taught myself that I can provide good insight with my new skills attained regarding web accessibility. This further grew as a greater ambition to become a professional web developer that not only builds nice graphics but keeps in mind a broader picture, more specifically to build better products that are performant, accessible and long lasting.
