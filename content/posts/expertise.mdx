## Eye Museum Accessibility Advice

Eye Museum is a semi government instance, therefore it is required to fulfill a certain degree of the official WCAG accessibility guidelines. The project managers at Bravoure reached out to me in order to seek advice on whether or not this is currently possible. The Eye Museum website was built and crafted by Bravoure, but no accessibility concerns were targeted from the briefing, leaving this out of scope in the beginning.

We were given a list of accessibility issues and the project managers outlined the most important ones.

Given my role as accessibility expert inside the company, I proceeded to review each issue and list down the possible solutions, as well as building a proof of concept based on their current website menu.

## Werken Bij Kindergarden Full Website

At the beginning of my internship I was given the not so short task of rebuilding the whole website of Werken Bij Kindergarden.

This website was built with Wordpress as a CMS and was really outdated. The developers at the company had built their very own theme. The main challenge was getting acquainted with very old code practices, fixing these and not breaking anything. It was tedious work, but I managed to get through every new error and fulfil my task.

For this project we used the scrum board method for staying organized.

## Change Inc.

On the contrary of Werken Bij Kindergarden, Change Inc. is built with the latest technologies such Next.js and Craft CMS, as well as GraphQL. These were exactly the technologies that I wanted to work with and get to know. Luckily for me I was able to join the team and build new parts of the website, such as:
