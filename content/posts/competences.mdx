Below I provide proof of completion of the FHICT Semester 5 competences.

<details>
    <summary>1 - Knowledge and Insight</summary>
    <p>
			I display a correct breadth and depth of the IT life cycle by taking part in each cycle and investing the appropiate time on each.
			I managed the whole project from the beginning starting with my <a href="/images/Project-Plan-v2.pdf">Project Plan</a>. In there, I defined the appropiate <a href="/posts/project-management">methodology</a> and tooling
			I made several analysis which can be found on my <a href="/posts/project-research">Project Research</a>
			I provided <a href="/posts/expertise">expert advice</a> towards the company stakeholders
			Following my analysis, and the feedback from the stakeholders, I proceeded to create a design which I then tested
			I realised several proof of concepts, including a whole project, apart from the <a href="/posts/project-realisation">major proof of concept for my internship project</a>
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			I display a high degree of independence and personal contribution in the creation of a complex project from start to end leading to a successful project. Furthermore, I display quite an initiative towards solving a social problem with business benefits. The information regarding the relevance of my project can be found in my <a href="/images/Project-Plan-v2.pdf">Project Plan</a>.
    </p>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>2a - Management</summary>
    <p>
			I display a correct management of this project by setting up a <a href="/images/Project-Plan-v2.pdf">Project Plan</a>, including the distribution of the corresponding tasks with the appropiate methodology and tooling which can be found in my <a href="/posts/project-management">Project Management</a> & <a href="/posts/tooling">Tooling</a> post item.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>2b - Analysis</summary>
    <p>
			I portray clearly the context, the problem and the challenge my project is trying to solve within my <a href="/images/Project-Plan-v2.pdf">Project Plan</a>
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			Furthermore, I made several analysis which can be found on my <a href="/posts/project-research">Project Research</a>, each analysis with the correct width and depth needed to lead to the design phase
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>2c - Advise</summary>
    <p>
			In my <a href="/posts/project-research">Project Research</a> I analyse the problem from different aspects, including the stakeholders interests, the available solutions, the posibilities, the costs and the benefits
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			I provided accessibility <a href="/posts/expertise">expert advice</a> towards the company stakeholders not only in my internship project but also in other projects.
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			I shared my findings and conclusions with the stakeholders with the appropiate documents
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>2d - Design</summary>
    <p>
			Following my analysis, and the feedback from the stakeholders, I proceeded to create a <a href="/posts/project-design">design</a> which I then tested
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			The form and content is appropiate to the assignment and context
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>2e - Realisation</summary>
    <p>
			I researched the appropiate technology stack needed by the project’s proof of concept before diving into the code blindy.
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			Next to the project’s realisation, I created several proof of concepts acting as an accessibility expert within the company
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			Next to the project’s realisation, I succeeded in the realisation of other big project involving the rebranding of a job vacancies website. The project got accepted by the client and is currently live: <a href="https://werkenbijkindergarden.nl/">https://werkenbijkindergarden.nl/</a>
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			The project’s realisation follows the <a href="/posts/project-design">design</a> stablished
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			The size of the project’s realisation reaches almost final production state and is in line with the context and time span given
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			The project’s realized product is already usable by the client and easily extensible towards own will
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>3 - Judgement</summary>
    <p>
			I formulate the right questions based on an unstructured problem leading to a succesful project. Most of these questions can be found in my Project Research, but also in the <a href="/posts/project-design">design</a> phase by running a usability test, as well as in the <a href="/posts/project-realisation">realisation</a> by searching for the right tools
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			I select the appropiate research methods and justify them with reference to the research strategies in my <a href="/images/Project-Plan-v2.pdf">Project Plan</a>. Later on I carry them out as planned and demonstrate its solidity on each phase of my project
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			I involve different aspects in the decision making process, primarily its social and ethical impact as well as the business benefits, including a scientific attitude towards research
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>4 - Communication</summary>
    <p>
			I account and defend the implementation of several professional assignments, including my own large internship assignment within my internship company both orally and in written form. Proof can be found in my <a href="/posts/expertise">presentations</a> and in my <a href="/images/Project-Plan-v2.pdf">Project Plan</a>.
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			I collaborate effectively in the independent execution of several professional assignments with my <a href="/posts/project-realisation">Project Realisation</a>, <a href="/posts/pocs">proof of concepts</a> and <a href="/posts/expertise">expert advice</a>
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>5 - Learning ability</summary>
    <p>
			I describe my successes, my talents and my development ambitions in relation to the ICT proffession in my <a href="/posts/expertise">expertise</a> document
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			I reflect on the received feedback during <a href="/posts/project-research">project research</a> and <a href="/posts/project-design">design</a>, and use it to further develop my project
    </p>
		<br />
    <p>
			I show initiative and an independent attitude towards an end result on a proffesional assignment outside of school
    </p>
