### How was the implementation planned and how did it go?

For this project I decided to use the Agile methodology. I divided this project and its subsequent tasks into 3 different sprints: research, design & development.
Next to Agile, and with the basic tasks already predefined, I decided to use the Waterfall method as well, more specifically with a Gantt Chart. I found this method easy to use and to understand, since all the tasks are dependent on its predecessor and it offers a clear overview of the whole project. However the dates did not always went according to plan, I managed to follow all the steps rigorously until the end of this project.

### What research questions did you address and with what approach?

Below you can find a table displaying the research questions and my approach.

          I constantly asked my colleagues for feedback and to look at my product
          concept. This proved to improve the final product.

### The Result

The end result is a ready to use digital product that will serve developers to further improve and facilitate the implementation of Web Accessibility within Bravoure's development team. In there, developers can find all the basic documentation needed in order to get started, really handy tools as well as a library with reusable components. This means developers don't have to go out there on their own to find how to implement web accessiblity, which is of great value because it reduces the time and costs previously needed. In short, the result is in line with the project's goal and gives an answer to the challenge: How Might We improve the developer experience when building an accessible application?
