## User Persona

In order to build more empathy with the end user, I decided to create a User Persona which in turn will also help me manoeuvre the design in the right direction. Specifying my audience will help me influence the features and design elements I choose, thus making my product more useful.

This User Persona is in line with the Project’s goal and was used for personal purposes in order to design a better solution appropriate to the target group in context.

## User Stories & Information Architecture

In order to keep my product user focused, I proceeded to create some User Stories.These are accessible and manageable and help create a “project mental model” from the beginning and onwards.

Next to the User Stories, I wrote down a couple of questions that would help me determine what I need to answer for the end user. This would further help me determine what are the main pages my product needed, building up the main Information Architecture.

## Layout Design Patterns

Looking back to the day to day applications the user utilizes, I realised there is a certain pattern all of them follow which you can see here below.

The common composition is a top nav bar with a left side panel, and sometimes a right panel as well, that cover all of the immediate links that are of high relevance. This makes it easier for the user to find the desired information at a blizz.

This was great because I could use the same structure for my design, making use of a mental model the end user already recognizes and minimising the mental effort needed to get used to my end product.

## Medium Fidelity Prototype

Having the goal, the Information Architecture and the layout design pattern defined, I proceeded to put everything into one place to define the User Experience. Below you can find my Medium Fidelity Prototype.

## Usability Test

For testing my design I created a Usability Test with Maze, which is a tool that helps me ask the user for different questions in regards to the design, all in the same place without having to switch between applications. I asked the testers to complete certain tasks and look 5 seconds at a screen to see if the information was clear. All the tasks were successfully completed and most of the users found the information clear. You can see the whole report here: [Maze Usability Report](https://app.maze.co/report/f99odtrky092sh1)

Finally I asked the testers to add some observations. Below the results.

The main takeout was how the buttons were organized and designed. These should be more clear to the user and immediately accessible without looking around.

## Medium Fidelity Prototype + Feedback

Finally, I added the feedback intro the prototype which can be found here: [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/NWfwWHATZCmp7MsthjuAkN/Low-Fi-Prototype----FEEDBACK?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=2%3A15&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.09&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=2%3A15)

## Final Conclusion

My design follows the advice proposed by my research as well as the feedback gathered and is elaborated on every step. Furthermore, I can use this design to develop a product usable for the client.
