## Agile

For this project I decided to use the Agile methodology since it seemed the most logical solution for a digital project as it is one the most standard methods used amongst development teams. With Agile I was able to work in short bursts on every particular deliverable. At the same time, Agile would help me stay organized with clear objectives.

## Scrum & Sprints

In my Project Plan you can find an initial draft of the tasks I defined for this project. I divided this project and its subsequent tasks into 3 different sprints: research, design & development.

## Waterfall & Gantt Chart

Next to Agile, and with the basic tasks already predefined, I decided to use the Waterfall method as well, more specifically with a Gantt Chart. I found this method easy to use and to understand, since all the tasks are dependent on its predecessor and it offers a clear overview of the whole project. Although Agile and Waterfall are two different methods, I found myself that both have their own advantages and that they can complement each other.
