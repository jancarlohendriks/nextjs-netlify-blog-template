## Werken Bij Kindergarden Full Website

At the beginning of my internship I was given the task of rebuilding the whole website of Werken Bij Kindergarden.

This website was built with Wordpress as a CMS and was really outdated. The developers at the company had built their very own theme. The main challenge was getting acquainted with very old code practices, fixing these and not breaking anything. It was tedious work, but I managed to get through every new error and fulfil my task.

The company CTO and the project manager for this project were very happy and the project launched online. You can see it here: [https://werkenbijkindergarden.nl/](https://werkenbijkindergarden.nl/)

## ADE Register form

Following my exploratory research, I got the chance to work on an accessibility issue affecting the register form for the Amsterdam Dance Event website. This was quite an issue since some options werenâ€™t available for screen readers leaving people with disabilities unable to register themselves.

The issue was caused by some custom inputs that lacked the right accessibility attributes ready for the screen reader to use. At the end I managed to solve this by finding and adding the right attributes.

The team was happy and this also proved to be a good exercise in order to get acquainted with the technology.

## Eye Museum Menu POC

The project managers reached out to me so I could help them with a current client that requested that their website was made accessible. I provided them with my advice regarding the main issues found. In addition to that, I created a small proof of concept that would serve to tackle one of the biggest issues: the navigation.

## Change Inc dropdown POC

For Change Inc, I got to work on the events page where an interactive accordion was needed. I first got the design and translated it to React code. Since I had built some accessibility expertise, I decided to use this knowledge and make this component accessible as well.

## Natwerk Paint Brush POC

For a new website, I was requested to build a small proof of concept demonstrating the feasibility of the concept. This concept was to use the mouse position to create different drawings, and afterwards make this drawing available to use later by saving a copy.
