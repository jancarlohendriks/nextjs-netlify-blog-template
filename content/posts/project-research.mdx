## The roadmap

After the design challenge was clear, which you can find in my [Project Plan v1](/images/Project-Plan-v1.pdf), I started to dig down into research, exploratory research to be more precise.

I went to look at what the guidelines are, which tools already exist and what are the best practices, and in general get more acquainted with the Web Accessibility world since this was a first timer for me. Hereafter I decided to update my [Project Plan v2](/images/Project-Plan-v2.pdf) where the research questions and methods are more clearly defined.

Below you can find a more detailed chart picturing this process.

## Literature Study

### Web Accessibility Requirements & Guidelines

After my first meeting with the company CTO, I pulled the official [WebAIM checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist), one of the major Web Accessibility consultants in the world, if not the biggest. This list group’s all of the 78 official WCAG accessibility success criteria. I then proceeded to categorize and filter these guidelines depending on their degree of difficulty and in terms of real application to our current projects, the main criteria was time.

You can donwload the filtered list here: [WebAIM Guidelines Priotiry List](/images/0.2-WebAIM-Guidelines-Priotiry-List.xlsx)

### Existing Tools

Furthermore, I went on with my research and looked for the tools available in the market. As expected, there were thousands, each with their unique pros and cons. Therefore, I decided to focus on the ones that were useful for the company, and followed the advice of some articles listing the most useful tools.

The clear winner was SorSite since it over delivered in all aspects. It works on the web, so no installation is needed, it checks not only one page but all the pages belonging to the same website which saves an incredible amount of time and displays a very clear overview of all the issues found in a nice report.

---

## Feedback & Decision making

After my initial research was concluded, I met again with the company CTO to review the results and define next steps.

Some feedback I got:

- Use the 80/20 rule → biggest output with least amount of input
- Zoom out of the project scope into a bigger vision/impact (not only focus in one client, but rather into a solution that is applicable to various clients)

In my research I also found that It is estimated that around 15 percent of the world’s population live with some sort of disability. So the logical formula would be:

more visitors === most probability of visitors with some disability

Luckily, this is a number Bravoure possesses because they use Google Analytics.

The plan after having the target websites was clear:

- Run Automated Checks (use the Sortsite Tool)
- Run Manual Tests

80/20 → Summarize things in common → frame project → step-by-step plan → action.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Clients With Most Visitors

Looking into all the data I came up with the following list. Because of privacy reasons I cannot display the actual visitor numbers of these clients.

<table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

2016-2017

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

PARADISO

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

<table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

PARADISO

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

ADE

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

EBBINGE

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">

BKS

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

I also wanted to look into the numbers before the pandemic to see if there was a correlation. Although the numbers for 2020-2021 are way lower than previously, the top 3 remain the same. The reason behind could also be that all the clients have been equally affected.

### Automated Accessibility Test

Since a lot of the problems in Web Accessibility can be found in the semantics used to build web applications, automated tools can scan all the code and bring back a list of all the errors found. Following my previous research I decided to use SortSite since it didn't require me to install any program and works fine on the web. Also, the trial and premium version scan all the pages of the same website, while most other tools don’t.

Here is the link to this awesome tool: [SortSite’s PowerMapper tool](https://try.powermapper.com/demo/sortsite=1641862033837320&usg=AOvVaw2TgKmSaGPrqiSBWjzw8hsf)

I ran the test on the 3 most visited client’s websites and created a pivot table, where the matching errors could be found. The following are the errors matched:

- Avoid specifying a new window as the target of a link with target=\_blank.
- Don't use CSS animations or transitions in interactions without giving the user a way to turn them off.
- Duplicate id - the same ID is used on more than one element.
- Each `<a>` element must contain text or an img with an alt attribute.
- Ensure that text and background colors have a 7:1 contrast ratio.
- Ensure that text and background colors have enough contrast.
- Headings should not be empty.
- HTML form control has no accessible name.
- iframe and frame elements must have a title attribute.
- Link uses general text like 'Click Here' with no surrounding text explaining link purpose.
- Several links on a page share the same link text, but go to different destinations.
- The CSS outline or border style on this element makes it difficult or impossible to see the dotted link focus outline.

You can download the whole test here: [Clients Most Visitors](/images/1.1-Clients-Most-Visitors.xlsx)

### Manual Accessibility Test

Next to the automated test, I also decided to run a manual test since not all issues can be found automatically. To do so, I followed quite a good article, [Manual Accessibility Testing: Why & How](https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/manual-accessibility-testing-why-how=1641862033838766&usg=AOvVaw0ARjTCWMXu658D7hvU7iKw).

The results can be found in the following matrix, where all 3 websites fail in most of the tests.

### Results

Having done all this research and analysed a lot of data, I bundled together a list of problems which are higher in priority from an accessibility point of view.

In general, I found that all websites fail in the following criteria:

The accordion component has a major relevance since it is widely used among almost every project.

### Advice Presentation

I presented my findings together with the following Advice document: [Web Accessibility For Bravoure](/images/1.4-Web-Accessibility-For-Bravoure.pdf)

The company’s CTO and my internship mentor were very glad to see all my progress.

Furthermore, the feedback that I received was that I could also bundle all of the solutions in one single place making it easy to reach. So instead of creating an extension that would only work on a certain text editor, I could make this tool available online so it wasn’t dependent on any text editor.

---

## Conclusion

The company CTO and my company mentor were very pleased to see all my advances and my research as all of the information and findings would help improve the current projects, but also projects in the future. With all the knowledge gathered, it became clear where our current clients are failing, what issues we can easily tackle down and which might be more difficult, as well as listing down available solutions which I can implement into the final product.

Additionally, my research will help create a good solution that can save the company a lot of time for implementing Web Accessibility.
