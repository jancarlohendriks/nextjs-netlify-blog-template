<p>
  After the design challenge was clear, which you can find in my Project Plan
  (v1), I started to dig down into research, exploratory research to be more
  precise.
</p>
<p>
  I went to look at what the guidelines are, which tools already exist and what
  are the best practices, and in general get more acquainted with the Web
  Accessibility world since this was a first timer for me. Hereafter I decided
  to update my Project Plan (v2) where the research questions and methods are
  more clearly defined.
</p>
<p>Below you can find a more detailed chart picturing this process.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Research (Literature Study)</h2>

<p>
  After my first meeting with the company CTO, I pulled the official
  <a href="https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist">
    WebAIM checklist
  </a>
  , one of the major Web Accessibility consultants in the world, if not the
  biggest. This list group&rsquo;s all of the 78 official WCAG accessibility
  success criteria. I then proceeded to categorize and filter these guidelines
  depending on their degree of difficulty and in terms of real application to
  our current projects, the main criteria was time.
</p>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>

Later on, I reviewed these with the company CTO where he agreed with my results. The most affordable solutions where the ones that can be automated with HTML.

<h3>Existing Tools</h3>

Furthermore, I went on with my research and looked for the tools available in
the market. As expected, there were thousands, each with their unique
pro&rsquo;s and cons&rsquo;. Therefore, I decided to focus on the ones that
were useful for the company, and followed the advice of some articles listing
the most useful tools. My preferred article and where I selected the tools are [here](https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/5-website-accessibility-checkers), and the Official Web Consortium Accessibility tools list can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/?q%3Dwcag-21-w3c-web-content-accessibility-guidelines-21)

  The clear winner was SorSite since it over delivered in all aspects. It works
  on the web, so no installation is needed, it checks not only one page but all
  the pages belonging to the same website which saves an incredible amount of
  time and displays a very clear overview of all the issues found in a nice
  report.

## Conclusions

So far, I managed to explore and analayse the available solutions for Web Accessibility. Not only that, but also list down the requirements for Web Accesiblity, categorize them in order to know what is feasable for the company and also summarize the tools that can help us the most. With all this knowlegde I was ready to embark the next step and explore how I can implement it to real use cases within the company.

In short, my findings can be summarized as follow:

- The easiest accessiblity issues to tackle down are those that involve HTML and proper semantics (use of code).
- Among the thousand of tools out there, SortSite provides the best solution to run a quick global automated test since it does not require any installation, can be run on the browser and provides a very clear and broad overview with information regarding the issues without the hassle of it being over bloated, making the information gathered quite comprehensive.

<h2>Decision making (Analysis)</h2>
<p>
  After my initial research was concluded, I met again with the company CTO to
  review the results and define next steps.
</p>
<p>Some feedback I got:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the 80/20 rule &rarr; biggest output with least amount of input</li>
  <li>
    Zoom out of the project scope into a bigger vision/impact (not only focus in
    one client, but rather into a solution that is applicable to various
    clients)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In my research I also found that It is estimated that around 15 percent of the
  world&rsquo;s population live with some sort of disability. So the logical
  formula would be:
</p>
<p>more visitors === most probability of visitors with some disability</p>
<p>
  Luckily, this is a number Bravoure possesses because they use Google
  Analytics.
</p>
<p>The plan after having the target websites was clear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run Automated Checks (use the Sortsite Tool)</li>
  <li>Run Manual Tests</li>
</ul>
<p>
  80/20 &rarr; Summarize things in common &rarr; frame project &rarr;
  step-by-step plan &rarr; action.
</p>

<h2>Clients With Most Visitors</h2>
<p>
  Looking into all the data I came up with the following list. Because of
  privacy reasons I cannot display the actual visitor numbers of these clients.

  I also wanted to look into the numbers before the pandemic to see if there was
  a correlation. Although the numbers for 2020-2021 are way lower than
  previously, the top 3 remain the same. The reason behind could also be that
  all the clients have been equally affected.

<h2>Automated Accessibility Test</h2>

<p>
  Since a lot of the problems in Web Accessibility can be found in the semantics
  used to build web applications, automated tools can scan all the code and
  bring back a list of all the errors found. Following my previous research I
  decided to use SortSite since it didn't require me to install any program and
  works fine on the web. Also, the trial and premium version scan all the pages
  of the same website, while most other tools don&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://try.powermapper.com/demo/sortsite">
    SortSite&rsquo;s PowerMapper tool
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  I ran the test on the 3 most visited client&rsquo;s websites and created a
  pivot table, where the matching errors could be found. The following are the
  errors matched:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Avoid specifying a new window as the target of a link with target=_blank.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't use CSS animations or transitions in interactions without giving the
    user a way to turn them off.
  </li>
  <li>Duplicate id - the same ID is used on more than one element.</li>
  <li>
    Each &lt;a&gt; element must contain text or an img with an alt attribute.
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that text and background colors have a 7:1 contrast ratio.</li>
  <li>Ensure that text and background colors have enough contrast.</li>
  <li>Headings should not be empty.</li>
  <li>HTML form control has no accessible name.</li>
  <li>iframe and frame elements must have a title attribute.</li>
  <li>
    Link uses general text like 'Click Here' with no surrounding text explaining
    link purpose.
  </li>
  <li>
    Several links on a page share the same link text, but go to different
    destinations.
  </li>
  <li>
    The CSS outline or border style on this element makes it difficult or
    impossible to see the dotted link focus outline.
    <hr />
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Manual Accessibility Test</h2>
<p>
  Next to the automated test, I also decided to run a manual test in case there
  was any issue not found yet. To do so I followed the following article:
  <a href="https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/manual-accessibility-testing-why-how">
    Manual Accessibility Testing: Why &amp; How
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  The results can be found in the following matrix, where all 3 websites fail in
  most of the tests.
</p>

<hr />

<p>I also run a manual test on the most popular pages of each website.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The company CTO and my company mentor were very pleased to see all my advances and my research as all of the information would help improve the current projects, but also projects in the future. With all the knowlegde gathered, it became clear where our current clients are failing, what issues we can easily tackle down and which might be more difficult, as well as listing down available solutions which I can implement into the final product. Additionally, my research will help create a good solution that can save the company a lot of time for implementing Web Accessibility.

Having done all this research and analysed a lot of data, I bundled together a
list of problems which are higher in priority from an accessibility point of
view.

<p>In general, I found that all websites fail in the following criteria:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>Problem</p>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>Priority</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>Website navigation</p>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>Critical</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>Content readability</p>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>High</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>Contrast Ratio</p>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>Low</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  Also, the most common components needing attention are the following:
</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>PROBLEM</p>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>RELEVANCE</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/accordion/accordion.html">
            accordion:
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>- no focus state</p>
        <p>- not machine readable</p>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>High</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>
          filter navigation appears after scrolling, dropdown not accessible
        </p>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>High</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>tickets widget</p>
      </td>
      <td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">
        <p>High</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The accoridon component has a major relevance since it is widely used among almost every project.

The following step will be to starting designing a solution. See [Project Design](/posts/project-design).
