### Notion

I used Notion for writing my Project Plan, for building and maintaining my Gantt chart and for keeping my scrum board. It proved to be pretty useful, especially for project management. Check it out: <https://www.notion.so/>

### Google Drive

I kept all my files in the same place, and within a well defined folder structure. I like the fact that I can reach my documents from every device as long as I am logged in with the same account, all my files stay synced. Check it out: <https://drive.google.com/>

### VS Code

This is the de facto code editor for front-end developers. It is lightweight but quite extensible and you can build pretty much all web projects with it. This is also the tool we use at Bravoure. Check it out: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

### GitHub

Also industry standard, it makes it easy to collaborate between developers and keeps the code base of every project organized. Check it out: <https://github.com/>

### Docker

This is similar to a Virtual Machine, but quite lighter and consumes less computer resources. Docker ensures all projects remain the same for all developers, it is mainly useful for backend applications that run complex applications. Check it out: <https://www.docker.com/>

### Windows Linux Subsystem

Although Windows is also suitable for development purposes, it is limited when trying to use Docker which only runs on MacOS and Linux. Furthermore, using command lines in the terminal is easier on MacOS and Linux, while on Windows it is a bit different. The Windows Linux Subsystem lets me run Linux within Windows itself, not having me to change between Operating Systems. Check it out: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>

### Figma

For my own project design, but also for working together with the design team every time I joined a project. Figma is an excellent design tool that has proved valuable and raised great popularity because of its simplicity, low learning curve and extensibility. Check it out: <https://www.figma.com/>

### Maze Design

Although it is limited to only one project with the free plan, nevertheless it is a great tool for running multiple tests at once and creating a nice report. Check it out: <https://maze.co/>

All these tools proved to be quite valuable and are currently incorporated into my workflow.
