## The problem

It is estimated that around 15 percent of the worldâ€™s population live with some sort of disability; for whom most of online services do not pay much attention to, leaving them isolated from the digital world. This also reflects on a companyâ€™s revenue since services without web accessibility do not provide a solution for completing basic transactions.

Bravoure, being a creative company that delivers digital products for other companies in the cultural sector, often times finds itself in the position where Web Accessibility is of relevance.

Furthermore, because some of Bravoure's clients are semi part of the government they are increasingly being requested by [law](https://digitoegankelijk.nl/wetgeving/wat-verplicht) to meet some of the Web Accessibility criteria.

Currently there is no integration of Web Accessibility within Bravoure's product pipeline, making it harder to implement.

## The goal

This project will deliver a solution for an easier implementation of Web Accessibility for the developers at Bravoure.

### ðŸ’¡ Design Challenge
How Might We improve the developer experience when building an accessible application?

### Key outcome

Developers can create accessible web components without the hassle of doing research for each component accessibility case.

### Research Questions


### Possible Solutions

- *What if developers could easily browse through a library of components to obtain the adequate tools for making accessible web components?*
- *What if developers had all the relevant information regarding Web Accessibility ready to use and at hand?*

## Requirements
- Ease of use is very important, developers should not have a hard time using this product.
- Developers need to be able to find and copy accessible code snippets
- Developers need to be able to get feedback on whether their code complies with accessibility standards.

## Deliverables
- Automated Accessibility Test
- Manual Accessibility Test
- Recommendations Slides (Advice Document)
- Product Prototype & Design
- Product POC

## Scope
The deliverables previously described are all within the scope of this project. Those are the products I will deliver for the project.
